description: Use any routed model from Claude Code — opencodex serves the Anthropic Messages API and gateway model discovery on the same port.
---

opencodex serves `POST /v1/messages` (plus `count_tokens`) alongside `/v1/responses`, so Claude
Code can use every routed provider — OAuth logins, account pools, key failover and sidecars
included — with zero extra auth work.

## Quickstart

```bash
ocx claude
```

`ocx claude` ensures the proxy is running, then launches Claude Code with the environment wired:

| Variable | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:<port>` |
| `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` | Your opencodex API key, or a local placeholder |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_GATEWAY_MODEL_DISCOVERY` | `1` (native `/model` picker discovery) |
| `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` | `claudeCode.model` (optional) |
| `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_HAIKU_MODEL` | `claudeCode.smallFastModel` (optional, legacy `ANTHROPIC_SMALL_FAST_MODEL` too) |

Variables you export yourself always win. Extra arguments pass through: `ocx claude -p "hello"`.

## The /model picker ("From gateway")

Claude Code 2.1.129+ can discover gateway models: it calls `GET /v1/models?limit=1000` and lists
entries in the native `/model` picker, labeled "From gateway". Because the picker only accepts ids
beginning with `claude` or `anthropic`, opencodex exposes routed models as stable, reversible
aliases:

```
claude-ocx-<provider>--<model>     e.g. claude-ocx-gemini--gemini-3-pro
claude-ocx-native--<slug>          e.g. claude-ocx-native--gpt-5.5   (native OpenAI models)
```

Each entry carries an honest display name such as `gemini-3-pro (gemini)`. Selecting one persists
it to Claude Code's `settings.json` `model` field; inbound requests resolve the alias back to the
routed model. On older Claude Code versions the picker stays native — set slots via
`ANTHROPIC_MODEL` or type any routed id with `/model` (Claude Code passes strings through).

## GUI

The dashboard has a dedicated **Claude** page (below API in the sidebar): the inbound kill switch,
quickstart and manual env block, default/small-fast slot pickers, a model map editor, and a preview
of the aliases the picker will discover. The sidebar also carries a **Claude ON** toggle (the label
is intentionally the same in every language) that flips the inbound on and off.

## Model map

`claudeCode.modelMap` rewrites inbound Anthropic model ids to routed models before routing:

```json
{
  "claudeCode": {
    "modelMap": {
      "claude-sonnet-4-5": "gemini/gemini-3-pro",
      "claude-haiku-4-5": "gemini/gemini-3-flash"
    }
  }
}
```

Lookup order: discovery alias, exact id, id with the date suffix stripped (`-20250514`), passthrough.

## Manual setup (without ocx)

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:10100
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=opencodex-local
export CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_GATEWAY_MODEL_DISCOVERY=1
claude
```

Or persist it in `~/.claude/settings.json` under the `env` key. Do not set both
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` — Claude Code reports an auth conflict.

## Notes and limits

- **Streaming first.** The inbound always streams internally; non-streaming clients get the folded
  message JSON.
- **Thinking.** Reasoning streams to Claude Code as `thinking` blocks (with a synthetic signature);
  thinking blocks replayed by Claude Code are dropped before routing — providers carry reasoning in
  their own envelopes.
- **count_tokens is an estimate.** Claude Code's context meter uses a character-based
  approximation; the endpoint is optional in the gateway protocol.
- **Kill switch.** `claudeCode.enabled: false` (GUI: Claude ON toggle) answers `/v1/messages` with
  403 and empties the discovery list.
- Requests appear in the Logs/Usage pages like any other routed traffic.
