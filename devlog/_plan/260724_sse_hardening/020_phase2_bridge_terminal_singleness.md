# 020 — Phase 2: Bridge terminal singleness + incomplete replay caching
# (classes 7, 5)

One PABCD cycle. Core capability: exactly one terminal event per turn, and
the replay store honors the bridge's documented caching contract.

## Scope

IN:
- src/bridge.ts (terminal exactly-once in bridgeToResponsesSSE)
- src/responses/state.ts (rememberResponseState accepts incomplete)
- tests: bridge-lifecycle, bridge, responses-state

OUT: adapter behavior (phase 1 landed), chat outbound (phase 3),
passthrough inspector reconstruction (bugfix train owns it).

## File change map

### 1. src/bridge.ts — MODIFY the adapter-event loop (~438) and terminal
### cases (:633, :699, plus catch block)

Current (verified): each terminal case ends with `terminated = true; break;`
which exits only the `switch`; the `for await` keeps consuming and a second
terminal re-emits. `[DONE]` fires after the loop (:741).

Change:
- Add a loop-level guard: after the switch, `if (terminated) break;` so the
  first terminal event (done / incomplete / error / synthesized catch
  terminal) ends adapter consumption.
- On breaking early, call the event iterator's `return?.()` inside a
  try/catch so a well-behaved adapter generator can clean up its upstream
  reader; a throwing cleanup must not replace the emitted terminal.
- Guard the synthesized post-loop terminals (`if (!terminated)` already
  exists for the no-terminal EOF path — keep it; it becomes unreachable
  after a real terminal, which is the point).
- Do NOT change event ordering before the terminal: closing open items,
  compaction emission, usage attachment all stay exactly as-is.

### 2. src/responses/state.ts — MODIFY rememberResponseState (:244-280)

Current (verified, :257):
```ts
if (response.status !== undefined && response.status !== "completed") return;
```

Change:
- Accept `"incomplete"` as storable: the bridge already calls
  onCompletedResponse for incomplete max_tokens turns with the comment
  "Still cache the partial output so previous_response_id replay works"
  (bridge.ts:658). New guard:
  `if (response.status !== undefined && response.status !== "completed"
  && response.status !== "incomplete") return;`
- Keep `"failed"` excluded: a failed turn's partial output must not become
  authoritative replay history.
- Cursor checkpointUsable logic unchanged (function_call presence check
  already covers incomplete tool turns).
- Update the docblock above rememberResponseState to state the incomplete
  contract explicitly.

### 3. src/bridge.ts — comment sync

The :658 comment becomes true after change 2; extend it to name the
state.ts guard so the two sides stop drifting.

## Accept criteria + activation scenarios

1. Adapter yields error then done (misbehaving generator): client receives
   response.failed exactly once, never response.completed; `[DONE]` still
   emitted exactly once. Activation: bridge-lifecycle test with a scripted
   event generator; assert terminal event sequence length 1.
2. Adapter yields done then trailing error: response.completed exactly
   once; trailing error swallowed (generator.return called).
3. incomplete (max_tokens) turn: rememberResponseState stores the partial
   items; a subsequent expandPreviousResponseInput with that
   previous_response_id returns prior items + suffix. Activation:
   responses-state test driving remember + expand directly.
4. failed turn: still NOT stored (guard keeps failing statuses out).
5. Regression: bridge.test.ts, bridge-lifecycle.test.ts,
   bridge-raw-reasoning-hidden.test.ts, responses-state.test.ts green;
   `bun run typecheck` green.

## Risks

- Breaking the loop early abandons unconsumed adapter events: any adapter
  that relies on full drainage for side effects would notice. Mitigation:
  adapters are pull-based generators; abandonment is the standard early-exit
  contract, and generator.return gives them a cleanup hook.
- Caching incomplete could replay a truncated turn into the next request:
  that is exactly the bridge's documented intent (continue-from-partial);
  the alternative (current behavior) sends a naked delta, which is worse.
