# 040 — Phase 4: Heartbeat / stall consistency (class 11)

One PABCD cycle. Hardening: upstream keepalive must reset the stall clock;
dead heartbeat code must be resolved one way or the other.

## Scope

IN:
- src/lib/sse-decoder.ts (optional comment/activity notification)
- src/adapters/anthropic.ts + src/adapters/google.ts (wire activity ->
  AdapterEvent heartbeat)
- src/bridge.ts (confirm heartbeat resets the adapter-activity clock; fix
  if it does not)
- src/server/relay.ts (relaySseWithHeartbeat dead code resolution)
- tests: sse-decoder, bridge-lifecycle (stall), anthropic/google stream
  suites

OUT: stall-timeout default tuning (300s stays), native passthrough
synthetic heartbeat wire-change (byte-verbatim contract; see decision
below), Cursor/Kiro (already emit heartbeat events).

## File change map

### 1. src/lib/sse-decoder.ts — MODIFY decodeServerSentEvents

Current (verified, :41): comment lines are dropped inside acceptLine.

Change (additive, backward-compatible — REVISED after A-gate: an
onActivity callback is insufficient because the decoder never yields for
comments, so consumers get no loop turn to observe activity):
- Extend options: `{ signal?: AbortSignal; includeComments?: boolean }`.
- When includeComments is true, comment records are YIELDED as
  `{ comment: string }` records (new optional field on ServerSentEvent or a
  distinct record shape — pin the exact shape in B; the contract is:
  comment frames become consumable loop turns). Blank keepalive lines
  without data stay non-yielding (no event loss, no noise).
- Callers that do not opt in see zero behavior change (chat/outbound keeps
  the current contract).

### 2. src/adapters/anthropic.ts — wire activity

At the decodeServerSentEvents call sites (:717, :740): opt into
includeComments and translate each yielded comment record into
`{ type: "heartbeat" }` so the bridge's adapter-activity clock resets.
This works because comment records now produce real loop turns (A-gate
fix). Rate: one heartbeat per comment record is acceptable (upstream
keepalives are typically 1/15-30s).

### 3. src/adapters/google.ts — wire activity

After phase 1's scanner remains line-based: treat any non-empty upstream
line that is not a data frame (comments, blanks) as liveness; emit
`{ type: "heartbeat" }` when no content event has been produced by the
current read batch. Keep it cheap: at most one heartbeat per read batch.

### 4. src/bridge.ts — verify heartbeat handling (:196 region)

AdapterEvent heartbeat must reset the same clock the stall timeout uses.
If the bridge currently only uses heartbeat for downstream keepalive,
extend it to also refresh the upstream-activity timestamp. This is a
verify-first item: read, then patch only if missing.

### 5. src/server/relay.ts — relaySseWithHeartbeat (:324)

Correction (A-gate finding): NOT zero-caller — exported via the server
barrel (src/server/index.ts:87) and consumed by passthrough-abort.test.ts:2.
No production call site, but it is a tested public export.
Decision: KEEP the export in this phase (no removal, no wire change);
record the deprecation question as a maintainer note in the D summary.
This phase does not touch it.

## Accept criteria + activation scenarios

1. Anthropic stream sending only `: keepalive` comments for N seconds
   during reasoning -> bridge receives heartbeat events; no
   upstream_stall_timeout fires while comments flow. Activation:
   bridge-lifecycle test with a comment-only generator and a shortened
   stall budget; assert no incomplete is synthesized.
1a. Comment-only INFINITE stream: heartbeats continue indefinitely, no
   stall, no terminal (activation of the exact A-gate failure mode).
1b. Truly silent upstream (no bytes at all) -> stall timeout still fires
   (regression pin).
2. Google comment-only keepalive -> same contract.
3. sse-decoder tests: existing 42 stay green without includeComments; new
   tests prove comment records yield when opted in and never otherwise.
4. `bun run typecheck` green; focused suites green.

## Risks

- Extra heartbeat events are already part of the AdapterEvent contract
  (Cursor/Kiro emit them), so the bridge/downstream tolerate them.
- Removing a dead export is a public-surface no-op (no callers), but the
  A gate must confirm no docs/scripts reference relaySseWithHeartbeat.
